# Supervised-Machine-Learning-and-Credit-Risk

## Background
In 2019, more than 19 million Americans had at least one unsecured personal loan. That's a record-breaking number! Personal lending is growing faster than credit card, auto, mortgage, and even student debt. With such incredible growth, FinTech firms are storming ahead of traditional loan processes. By using the latest machine learning techniques, these FinTech firms can continuously analyze large amounts of data and predict trends to optimize lending.

In this module, you'll use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
